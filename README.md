![Landing Page](https://preview.ibb.co/gOTa0y/LAMP_STACK.png)

  

A basic LAMP stack environment built using Docker Compose. It consists of the following:

* PHP
* Apache
* MySQL
* phpMyAdmin
* Redis

As of now, we have several different PHP versions. Use appropriate php version as needed:

* 5.4.x
* 5.6.x
* 7.1.x
* 7.2.x
* 7.3.x
* 7.4.x

> Please note that we simplified the project structure from several branches for each php version, to one centralized master branch. Please let us know if you encouter any problems. 
##  Installation
 
* Clone this repository on your local computer
* configure .env as needed 
* Run the `docker-compose up -d`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/webmidas/docker-lamp.git
cd docker-compose-lamp/
cp sample.env .env

```

Your LAMP stack is now ready!! You can access it via `http://localhost`.

## Why you shouldn't use this stack unmodified in production
We want to empower developers to quickly create creative Applications. Therefore we are providing an easy to set up a local development environment for several different Frameworks and PHP Versions. 
In Production you should modify at a minimum the following subjects:

* php handler: mod_php=> php-fpm
* secure mysql users with proper source IP limitations
